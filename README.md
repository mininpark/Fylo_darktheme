## My process

### Built with

- Node JS with NPM API Express and Mailchimp
- Body Parser in JS
- JSON
- Modern Asynchronous JavaScript with Async and Await
- Bootstrap and CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I learned to use API (Endpoints, Paths, Parameters, Authentication and Postman) and understood the logic of JSON.
- I learned also how to use NPM. 
- GET Requests is used with the NodeHTTPS Module by parsing JSON and Body Parser is used to parser POST Requests to the server (Async/Await).
- Express is used to render a website with Live API Data and Mailchimp API is used to interact with Users by getting email address. 
- Success and Failure Pages for getting email address are also added, when it's going wrong. 
- I got the error 401 (unautorised) even after logging in and auth-token being present. 

### Continued development

- To solve error 401
